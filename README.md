# CRS Ontology

This repository is being used to work toward the development of an official OGC CRS ontology.

At present, we're simply working on documenting the benefits of a CRS ontology, but we're hoping that more will come as people determine value in the work.

We're listing the benefits below.

- An official CRS ontology will allow CRS registries to be made available on the Web.
  - CRS registries on the web will allow direct lookups of relevant CRS data by both human users and machine algorithms.
- An official CRS ontology will make the OGC CRS model available to web developers.
- An official CRS ontology allows publication of standard OGC CRS registry as Web data.
  - An official OGC CRS registry allows existing Web practices to be underpinned with shared semantics (for example: [HTML5 Geolocation](https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation/), [W3C basic geo](https://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/), [schema.org GeoCoordinates](https://schema.org/GeoCoordinates)).
- A CRS Ontology will allow custom CRSs to be published on the Web with proper semantic foundation.
  - Users of data stores that support GeoSPARQL are now limited to a limited collection of CRSs supported by the data store.
- Stand-alone systems that do not publish data on the Web can benefit from access to up-to-data CRS data, without the need for local copies that run the risk of being outdated.
- An official CRS ontology based on [OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Referencing by coordinates](https://docs.opengeospatial.org/as/18-005r4/18-005r4.html), which only covers geography, will allow ontological extensions to be published. Extensions to the model could provide means to define extraterrestial CRSs, or other CRSs that do not have a direct connection with the Earth's surface.
