# CRS Ontology

This repository is being used to work toward the development of a CRS ontology.

At present, we're simply working on documenting the benefits of a CRS ontology, but we're hoping that more will come as people determine value in the work.

We're listing the benefits below.

- A CRS Ontology will allow CRS registries to be made available on the Web
- CRS registries on the web will allow direct lookups of relevant CRS data by both human users and machine algorithms
- A CRS Ontology will make the OGC CRS model available to web developers
- A CRS Ontology will allow custom CRSs to be published on the web with proper semantic foundation
