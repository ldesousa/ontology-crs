# CRS Ontology

This repository is being used to work toward the development of a CRS ontology.

At present, we're simply working on documenting the benefits of a CRS ontology, but we're hoping that more will come as people determine value in the work.

We're listing the benefits below.

- An official CRS Ontology will allow CRS registries to be made available on the Web
  - CRS registries on the web will allow direct lookups of relevant CRS data by both human users and machine algorithms
- An official CRS Ontology will make the OGC CRS model available to web developers
- An official CRS Ontology allows publication of standard OGC CRS registry as web data
  - An official OGC CRS registry allows existing web practices to be underpinned with shared semantics (for example: [HTML5 Geolocation](https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation/), [W3C basic geo](https://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/), [schema.org GeoCoordinates](https://schema.org/GeoCoordinates))
- A CRS Ontology will allow custom CRSs to be published on the web with proper semantic foundation
